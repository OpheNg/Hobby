    <p>The counterpart of a static pole is a spinning pole. These are made to spin in the direction of your movements. <br>
    As your movements apply force on the pole, the pole also starts to spin with the pull. That gives you an added momentum, which can even get out of control if you don't have enough practice.
    It does make it easier to spin because the pole helps you, and you can feel like you are flying in no time. Care must be taken however, to avoid injury.
    Spinning poles are more expensive, but they usually have the option to switch to static mode, so that's a plus.</p>
