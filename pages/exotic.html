        Exotic pole dance utilises the basics of traditional pole dancing and demands the same level of endurance, strength, and skill, however the main difference is the introduction of a more sensual element.
        Exotic pole dancing is always practiced and performed to music, so the art of dance is extremely important. Pole moves and dance moves are carefully combined in routines which flow seamlessly to the beat of the music.
        The dance Choreography used in exotic pole dance tends to incorporate the use of the floor.
        Somewhere traditional pole dancers may rarely venture to! Floor work can incorporate many moves including crawling and sliding, all of which add to that exotic element.
        Heels are worn for exotic pole dancing.Although exotic pole dancers may make it look super easy, don't be fooled!
        Dancing in such high heels can be tricky and requires a lot of practice.
