        Pole dance combines dance and acrobatics centered on a vertical pole.
        This performance art form takes place not only in gentleman's clubs as erotic dance, but also as a mainstream form of fitness, practiced in gyms and dedicated dance studios.  <br>
        Amateur and professional pole dancing competitions are held in countries around the world.
        Pole dance requires significant muscular endurance, coordination, strength, flexibility, upper body and core stability, as well as sensuality. <br>
        As such, proper instruction and rigorous training are necessary to attain proficiency.
        Pole dance is regarded as a form of exercise which can be used as both an aerobic and anaerobic workout.
        Recognized schools and qualifications are now commonplace.
