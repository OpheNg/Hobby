    <h2>This complete sport, comes with 3 different categories, for all tastes!</h2>
    <p >Wheter you like to dance with the music rythm, or improve your strength, or even express yourself with sensuality.</p>

        <h4>Static pole</h4>
        <p>Static or stationary poles are those which don't spin when you dance on them. <br> Static poles usually have a single functionality (while spinning ones can also be operated in static mode). <br>
        Thus they are also cheaper compared to spinning poles, but you can't upgrade them to add the spin functionality later on.
        The advantage to using a static pole is that it prevents you from getting too much momentum initially when you are just trying to learn the basics of a dance move.
        You don't have to focus on the movement of the pole at all, just your own position and technique. You also need less muscle control, grip, and strength to hold on to something that is static.</p>

        <h4>Spinning pole</h4>
        <p>The counterpart of a static pole is a spinning pole. These are made to spin in the direction of your movements. <br>
        As your movements apply force on the pole, the pole also starts to spin with the pull. That gives you an added momentum, which can even get out of control if you don't have enough practice.
        It does make it easier to spin because the pole helps you, and you can feel like you are flying in no time. Care must be taken however, to avoid injury.
        Spinning poles are more expensive, but they usually have the option to switch to static mode, so that's a plus.</p>

        <h4>Exotic pole</h4>
        <p>Exotic pole dance utilises the basics of traditional pole dancing and demands the same level of endurance, strength, and skill, however the main difference is the introduction of a more sensual element. This is done in several ways: <br>
        Exotic pole dancing is always practiced and performed to music, so the art of dance is extremely important. Pole moves and dance moves are carefully combined in routines which flow seamlessly to the beat of the music.
        The dance Choreography used in exotic pole dance tends to incorporate the use of the floor.
        Somewhere traditional pole dancers may rarely venture to! Floor work can incorporate many moves including crawling and sliding, all of which add to that exotic element.
        Heels are worn for exotic pole dancing. Very high ones in fact!
        This not only adds a more exotic appearance to the routine but gives the dancer an undeniable sense of sensuality and confidence.
        Although exotic pole dancers may make it look super easy, don't be fooled!
        Dancing in such high heels can be tricky and requires a lot of practice.</p>
