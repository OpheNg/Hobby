        Static or stationary poles are those which don't spin when you dance on them. Static poles usually have a single functionality (while spinning ones can also be operated in static mode).
        Thus they are also cheaper compared to spinning poles, but you can't upgrade them to add the spin functionality later on.
        The advantage to using a static pole is that it prevents you from getting too much momentum initially when you are just trying to learn the basics of a dance move.
        You don't have to focus on the movement of the pole at all, just your own position and technique. You also need less muscle control, grip, and strength to hold on to something that is static.
